# 901: Prefer Rigid Checks Over Flexible Ones

In runtime logic, prefer an explicit, exact check over a loose one. Write `host.equals("localhost:8080")`, not `host.contains("localhost")`; match the whole value rather than a substring, unless a substring is genuinely what you mean.

This applies to production code, not tests. In a test it is often easier, and perfectly fine, to assert on part of a value — `assertTrue(message.contains("quota exceeded"))` rather than matching the whole message — so do not flag a partial check in a test.

**Rationale:** In runtime logic a loose check quietly accepts input you did not intend and hides bugs behind apparent success, so an exact check is safer. A test only needs to confirm the relevant part of an outcome, and pinning it to the whole message makes the test brittle for no benefit.

A violation is a substring or otherwise loose check standing in for an exact comparison in runtime logic. A partial check in a test is not a violation.
