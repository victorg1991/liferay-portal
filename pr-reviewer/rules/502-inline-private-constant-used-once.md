# 502: Inline a Private Constant Used Once

A `private static final` constant that is referenced only once should be inlined at its single use site rather than declared separately.

**Rationale:** A named constant earns its place by being reused, or by naming a value whose meaning would not otherwise be obvious. A constant referenced exactly once, whose name only echoes its own literal, adds a declaration to read and a lookup to resolve for no benefit. Inlining it puts the value where it is used.

A violation is a `private static final` constant with exactly one reference, where the literal can be inlined at that reference without losing meaning.

**Example:** commit `f7fbc55` inlined `_DEFAULT_SCRIPTING_JOB_NAME`, used once, back to its literal; `94f7e4a` collapsed a static initializer that populated a single field into a direct `Set.of(...)` initializer.
